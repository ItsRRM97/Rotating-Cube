# Rotating-Cube

A 3-D Rotating Cube using Trigonometry to determine the initial &amp; final position of each of the 8 Points in JavaScript

Rotating Cube wireframe: Draw a 3D Cube wireframe and rotate it along the axes that passes through its center. The rotating object should decelerate at a rate of ‘X’ degrees/sec^2 before it comes to a standstill.

The object should respond as follows to the following user inputs
Swipe
/Drag
: Accelerates or decelerates the rotating object as per the difference in velocity
between
 
rotation and swipe with the friction factor Y.
Touch
/Click
 generates friction that should decelerate the rotation further by a Y (friction factor)
